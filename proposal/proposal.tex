\section{Summary}
For our project, we would like to apply Machine Learning techniques to predict
stock prices. We would like to try to scrape financial articles from new
outlets online and perform analysis on the sentiments expressed in those
articles to predict how stock prices would be affected in the near future. We
could also consider specific industries such as oil or tech and seeing how they
might influence each other.
