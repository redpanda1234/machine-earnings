\section{Summary}
For our project, we would like to apply Machine Learning techniques to
predict stock prices. We would like to try to scrape financial
articles from new outlets online and perform analysis on the
sentiments expressed in those articles to predict how stock prices
would be affected in the near future. We could also consider specific
industries such as oil or tech and seeing how they might influence
each other.

\section{Network architecture}
We will give an input tensor of time-series data scraped from
financial websites. These will then pass into an LSTM neural network
(implemented in \texttt{tensorflow}), then pass through a small
softmax layer, which will output one of three decisions: buy, sell, or
do nothing.

\section{Cost function}
We will establish a simple cost function by looking at the network's
total gains / losses, measured with respect to the starting balance
some period of time earlier.

\section{Datasets}
We will be trying to scrape data from one of the following APIs:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{alphavantage}
  \item \texttt{quandl}
  \item \texttt{morningstar}
\end{itemize}
